# AWS Provider Index Migration Plan

## Overview
This project was originally designed for indexing the AzureRM Terraform provider but needs to be adapted for the AWS Terraform provider. The main challenge is that AWS provider uses a completely different service registration pattern compared to AzureRM.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL COMPATIBILITY WARNING

**DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING TYPES**: `TerraformResource`, `TerraformDataSource`, and `TerraformEphemeral`

These types represent the **public API** of this tool and are used by external consumers. Any changes to their structure will break backward compatibility. The AWS migration must work **within** the constraints of these existing types.

## Development Methodology
All development must strictly follow a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. Changes should be made in small, incremental, and safe steps to ensure stability and maintain high code quality.

1.  **Write a Failing Test**: Before writing any implementation code, create a targeted test that captures the new requirement and fails as expected.
2.  **Write Code to Pass**: Write the simplest, most direct code necessary to make the failing test pass.
3.  **Refactor**: Once the test is passing, refactor the code for clarity, performance, and maintainability, ensuring all tests continue to pass.

This iterative process is mandatory for all changes in this project.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Migration Strategy**

### **Core Philosophy: Gradual Transition with Dual System Support**

The migration from AzureRM to AWS provider follows a **parallel coexistence strategy** where both the legacy AzureRM structure and the new AWS 5-category structure operate simultaneously during the transition period. This ensures zero downtime and maintains backward compatibility throughout the migration.

### **Key Migration Principles**

1. **üîí API Stability**: The public API types (`TerraformResource`, `TerraformDataSource`, `TerraformEphemeral`) remain completely unchanged to preserve backward compatibility for external consumers.

2. **üìä Dual Data Structures**: The `ServiceRegistration` struct contains both:
   - **AWS 5-category structure** (lines 15-19): `AWSSDKResources`, `AWSSDKDataSources`, `AWSFrameworkResources`, `AWSFrameworkDataSources`, `AWSEphemeralResources`
   - **Legacy AzureRM structure** (lines 22-29): `SupportedResources`, `SupportedDataSources`, etc.

3. **üîÑ Progressive Integration**: Each AWS category is integrated incrementally:
   - Phase 3.2.1: SDK Resources ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete
   - Phase 3.2.2: SDK Data Sources ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete  
   - Phase 3.2.3: Framework Resources ‚Üí üéØ Current
   - Phase 3.2.4: Framework Data Sources ‚Üí ‚åõ Pending
   - Phase 3.2.5: Ephemeral Resources ‚Üí ‚åõ Pending

4. **üß™ Test-First Development**: Every change follows strict TDD methodology with comprehensive integration tests to ensure reliability.

### **Migration Phases and Data Flow**

#### **Current State (Phase 3.2)**
```
AWS Provider Scanning ‚Üí AWS 5-Category Extraction ‚Üí ServiceRegistration (Dual Structure) ‚Üí File Writing (Uses Both Systems)
```

- **AWS Categories**: Populated by `processAWSServiceFile()` ‚Üí Used in `WriteResourceFiles()`, `WriteDataSourceFiles()`
- **Legacy Fields**: Still used for compatibility ‚Üí Will be gradually phased out in Phase 4

#### **Target State (Phase 4)**
```
AWS Provider Scanning ‚Üí AWS 5-Category Extraction ‚Üí ServiceRegistration (AWS Only) ‚Üí File Writing (AWS Only)
```

- **AWS Categories**: Primary data source for all operations
- **Legacy Fields**: Removed or marked as truly deprecated

### **File Writing Strategy**

The current file writing approach demonstrates the migration strategy:

1. **Parallel Processing**: `WriteResourceFiles()` and `WriteDataSourceFiles()` process both legacy and AWS data structures
2. **Consistent Output**: Both systems produce identical JSON structure via conversion functions
3. **Gradual Switchover**: As AWS categories are integrated, they take precedence over legacy fields

### **Conversion Function Pattern**

Each AWS category uses dedicated conversion functions that map to the unchanged public API:

- `NewTerraformResourceFromAWSSDK()` ‚Üí `TerraformResource`
- `NewTerraformDataSourceFromAWSSDK()` ‚Üí `TerraformDataSource`
- `NewTerraformResourceFromAWSFramework()` ‚Üí `TerraformResource` (pending)
- And so on...

### **Statistics and Progress Tracking Migration**

The statistics calculation demonstrates the dual approach:
```go
// Legacy counts (will be removed in Phase 4)
stats.LegacyResources += len(serviceReg.SupportedResources)
stats.TotalDataSources += len(serviceReg.SupportedDataSources)

// AWS counts (new, permanent)
stats.TotalResources += len(serviceReg.AWSSDKResources)
stats.TotalDataSources += len(serviceReg.AWSSDKDataSources)
```

### **When The Full Switchover Happens**

**Phase 4: Configuration Updates** is when the complete transition occurs:
- Update main index filename to "terraform-provider-aws-index.json"
- Remove or deprecate all legacy field usage
- Update all progress messages for AWS context
- Finalize statistics calculation for 5-category system only

### **Risk Mitigation**

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Every integration phase includes full test coverage
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Public API never changes
3. **Incremental Rollout**: One category at a time reduces blast radius
4. **Dual System Validation**: Both systems can be compared for correctness during transition

### **Success Metrics**

- ‚úÖ All existing tests continue to pass
- ‚úÖ New AWS-specific tests achieve 100% coverage  
- ‚úÖ File output format remains identical
- ‚úÖ Performance characteristics maintained or improved
- ‚úÖ Zero breaking changes to public API

This strategy ensures a safe, reliable migration that maintains system stability while enabling full AWS provider support.

## Migration Status

### ‚úÖ **Completed Milestones**

- **Phase 1: Research & Analysis**: Successfully analyzed the AWS provider structure, identifying the 5-category registration system which is fundamentally different from AzureRM's map-based approach.
- **Phase 2: Core Function Replacement**:
    - **2.1: AWS Extraction Functions**: Implemented a full suite of extraction functions for all 5 AWS categories (SDK/Framework/Ephemeral Resources & Data Sources).
    - **2.2: Factory Function Analysis**: Implemented `extractFactoryFunctionDetails` to parse factory functions for both SDK and Framework patterns, extracting CRUD and lifecycle methods.
    - **2.3: AzureRM Cleanup**: Completely removed all legacy AzureRM-specific extraction logic, cleaning up over 1000 lines of code.
- **Phase 3: Architecture Adaptation**:
    - **3.1: Dynamic Service Package Discovery**: Replaced hardcoded filenames with a dynamic discovery mechanism that identifies service files based on method presence, making the system robust against provider changes.
    - **3.2.1: SDK Resources Integration**: Successfully integrated the `extractAWSSDKResources` function into the main scanning pipeline. SDK resources are now correctly identified, processed, and written to index files, maintaining API compatibility.
    - **3.2.2: SDK Data Sources Integration**: Successfully integrated the `extractAWSSDKDataSources` function into the main scanning pipeline. SDK data sources are now correctly identified, processed, and written to index files with proper backward compatibility and method extraction support.

### üöß **Current Phase & Next Steps**

The project is currently in **Phase 3.2**, focusing on integrating the remaining AWS resource categories into the main pipeline. 

**‚úÖ JUST COMPLETED: Phase 3.2.2 - SDK Data Sources Integration**

#### üéØ **Current Task Details: Phase 3.2.3 - Framework Resources Integration**

**Objective**: Integrate AWS Framework Resources into the main scanning pipeline.

**Scope**:
- Connect `extractAWSFrameworkResources()` to the main `ScanProviderPackages()` function.
- Update the `ServiceRegistration` struct to handle Framework resource arrays.
- Map AWS Framework resource info to the existing `TerraformResource` API for backward compatibility.
- Handle Framework-specific lifecycle methods and configurations.
- Support modern Framework patterns alongside legacy SDK patterns in the same service.

**Implementation Steps**:
1.  **Update `ServiceRegistration`**: Add an `AWSFrameworkResources` field.
2.  **Update `ScanProviderPackages()`**: Call `extractAWSFrameworkResources()` and populate the new field.
3.  **Update `WriteResourceFiles()`**: Process `AWSFrameworkResources` alongside `AWSSDKResources`.
4.  **Create `NewTerraformResourceFromAWSFramework()`**: A new mapping function for Framework resources.
5.  **Create Integration Tests**: In a new file `pkg/aws_framework_resources_integration_test.go`, test single, multiple, and mixed (SDK/Framework) resource scenarios.
